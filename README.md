## Introduction

During my internship at Codsoft, I worked on several data science projects that involved real-world data, statistical analysis, and machine learning algorithms. This repository is a collection of those projects, showcasing my approach to solving data-driven problems and my proficiency in various data science tools and techniques.

## MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON
- **Description**: This project focuses on predicting movie ratings using machine learning techniques in Python. The objective is to develop a model that can forecast a movie's rating based on various features such as genre, cast, director, and release year, using data from movie datasets.

- **Key Features**: 
  -  **Data Collection:** Utilized movie datasets from sources like IMDb or The Movie Database (TMDb) to gather features relevant to movie ratings.
  - **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and transformed the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing features.
  - **Feature Engineering:** Created new features and selected relevant ones to enhance the model’s predictive power.

- **Results**: 
  - The model achieved an accuracy of X% in predicting movie ratings on the test set.
  - Identified key features influencing movie ratings, providing insights into what factors contribute most to a film’s success.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Git
